# Predicting-Chicago-Housing-Market-with-ML

The housing price has been on the rise since 2016 and increase up to 30% recently in some parts of the country. Whether this trend could continue or it is reminiscent of the market before 2008 housing market crash is a question in many people's minds. I decided to analyse the housing market data from 1990 to present and use machine learning to model the market and to predict the trend.
